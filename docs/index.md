## About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition 2.0 is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over half a million regular users, it’s a powerful, open-source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

Portainer works by hiding the complexity that makes managing contains hard behind an easy to use GUI. By negating the need for users to use CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so simple, anyone can do it.

The Portainer development team is here to assist you on your container journey; you can engage with them any time through our community-based support channels.

## Support Channels

As the Portainer community continues to grow, we continue to support the community to the best of our ability.  
Being a free and opensource product, we have been heavily reliant on our community to provide "how to" support to our community, recently we have invested significant time in improving and updating our documentation found on this site and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7diMJcrULjDseq5yhSUZgg). While we endeavour to cover as many scenarios as possible there may be some that our documentation doesn’t cover. 

To streamline our operations and allow us to focus on delivering the right support and features in the right areas at the right time we encourage our users to do the following:

* <b>QUESTIONS</b> should be posted to either [Github Issues](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues) or the [community Slack channel](https://portainer.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDk3ODQ5MjI2MjI4LTcwNGYxMWQ5OGViYWZkNDY2ZjY4YTMwMTgzYmU4YmNiOTU0MDcxYmJjNTIyYmQ0MTM5Y2QwNTg3NzNkMTk5MDg#/). While other platforms exist (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow) the Portainer team is less active in these. If you are uncomfortable posting your question publicly you can contact us via the Contact Us widget at the bottom of screen, we will respond as soon as we are able to. 

*	Suspected <b>BUGS</b> should be posted to Github and will be managed by our support and development teams as appropriate.

*	<b>VULNERABILITIES</b> should be emailed to [security@portainer.io](mailto:security@portainer.io) and will be dealt with immediately.
