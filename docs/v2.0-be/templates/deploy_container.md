# Deploy a standalone app (Container)

From Portainer, you can deploy a standalone app from the default template list.

## Deploying an standalone app

To deploy a standalone container from the templates, you need to go to <b>App Templates</b>, enable the toggle <b>Show container templates</b> and pick the app you want to deploy. For this example, we will deploy an Apache Web Server.

You will see an animation in the button while the container is deploying:
