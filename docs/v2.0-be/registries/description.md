# Registry Management Description

The Registry Manager is a feature of Portainer Business Edition, that extends your container management experience with the capability to browse defined registries and manipulate their content. By using the Registry Manager feature, container users enjoy the benefit of having a single interface to manage any Docker registry deployment*, providing a consistent look and feel across any provider.

The Registry Manager feature enables simple operational management of your docker registries and their content, such as browsing the registries, exploring repositories and images, manipulating the tags that are attached to repositories and images, adding new tags, and deleting existing tags. 

Portainer Business Edition enables you to retag an image as a means to promote it through the deployment lifecycle, or simply add or remove tags to annotate changes or usage. Also allows you to clean up legacy images by safely deleting unused images.

<b>*</b> The registry must support Docker Registry API v2. Currently supported registries: Private Docker registry, Azure Container Registry, Sonatype Nexus3.
