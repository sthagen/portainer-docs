# Enable Edge Computing features

In todayâ€™s world you can easily have hundreds - if not thousands - of Docker-enabled devices in your environment. Most of these systems run without any form of clustering or run a lean orchestrator such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

Remote devices may be distributed across multiple sites and/or across many different networks, some may even be attached to the internet using mobile data or satellite. To be managed effectively, engineers need a way to control distributed instances centrally, which is exactly what Portainer does with Edge Computer Features.

First you must enable Edge Compute in the Portainer Settings.

1. Click <b>Settings</b> and scroll down to <b>Edge Compute</b> section.
