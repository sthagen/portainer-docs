# Portainer Version Upgrade Path

We have tested and validated Portainer Version Upgrades from 1.24.0 to the latest (2.1.1). Although un-tested, it is possible an upgrade path that has not been validated might work. 
You are recommended to test any upgrade path, validated or non-validated on a non critical system before applying it to your active production systems.

You can find Requirements for different versions of Portainer [here](../../deploy/requirements/)
